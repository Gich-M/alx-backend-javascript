# ES6 Data Manipulation

This project contains a series of JavaScript functions that demonstrate various ES6 data manipulation techniques. It is part of the ALX Backend JavaScript curriculum.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several JavaScript files, each containing a specific function:

- `0-get_list_students.js`: Returns an array of student objects.
- `1-get_list_student_ids.js`: Returns an array of student IDs.
- `2-get_students_by_loc.js`: Filters students by location.
- `3-get_ids_sum.js`: Calculates the sum of student IDs.
- `4-update_grade_by_city.js`: Updates student grades by city.
- `5-typed_arrays.js`: Creates an Int8 typed array.
- `6-set.js`: Creates a Set from an array.
- `7-has_array_values.js`: Checks if a Set contains all elements from an array.
- `8-clean_set.js`: Cleans a Set based on a starting string.
- `9-groceries_list.js`: Creates a Map of groceries.
- `10-update_uniq_items.js`: Updates unique items in a Map.
- `100-weak.js`: Implements a WeakMap for API query counting.
